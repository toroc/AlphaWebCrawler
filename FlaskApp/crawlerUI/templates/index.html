    <h1>Alpha's Graphical Web Crawler</h1>
    <p class="lead">This application is an implementation of the Graphical Web Crawler project option presented by the instructor for Oregon State's Capstone 419. We have created a tiered web application, with a web crawling service on a back end server, a web server handling client requests, routing them to the back end, and serving responses back to the client, with a scripted graphics front end.</p>
